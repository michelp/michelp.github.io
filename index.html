    <p>Hello and welcome to my github pages.  I use this space as part
    of my resume stack so people can get an idea of what kind of code
    and projects I get into.</p>

    <p>Most of my repositories here reflect learning exercises I've
    undertaken to acquire new skills and experiences with specific
    software tools.  It goes back quite some time so some of this code
    is really no longer relevant.</p>
