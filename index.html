    <h1>Michel Pelletier</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my github pages.  I use this space as part
    of my resume stack so people can get an idea of what kind of code
    and projects I get into.</p>

    <p>I am a programmer, outdoor enthusiast, and amateur photographer
    living in Portland, Oregon, USA.  When I'm not outside, I tend to
    be found working with computers.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Python has been my bread and butter language since 1997.</li>
      <li>C was my first language and always my favorite.  Lately I've
      been using those skills to experiment and learn CUDA.</li>
      <li>SQL is how I talk to my favorite database, Postgres, which I
      love to use for many of my projects.</li>
      <li>bash is my pocket knife.</li>
      <li>lisp is such a pretty thing, I can't help but admire it's
      elegance.</li>
      <li>And, you know, some Java.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most of my repositories here reflect learning exercises I've
    undertaken to acquire new skills and experiences with specific
    software tools.  It goes back quite some time so some of this code
    is really no longer relevant.</p>
