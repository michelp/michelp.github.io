    <h1>Michel Pelletier</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my github pages.  I use this space as part
    of my resume stack so people can get an idea of what kind of code
    and projects I get into.</p>

    <p>I am a programmer, outdoor enthusiast, and amateur photographer
    living in Portland, Oregon, USA.  When I'm not outside, I tend to
    be found working with computers.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>At various points of my childhood I was lucky enough to have
      regular access to several computers including the Apple II and
      TI 99 4A.  My first languages were BASIC and FORTH.</li>

      <li>As a teenager C was my first serious language and always my
      favorite.  I used Borland's Turbo C++ compiler on a 386 running
      DOS.  Lately I've been using those skills to experiment and
      learn CUDA.</li>

      <li>My first Linux install was on a 486 PC clone in 1996.  I
      remember it taking many hours to build the kernel.  I've never
      used any other computer operating system since.</li>

      <li>Python has been my bread and butter language since 1997.  I
      wrote a lot of code for the Zope web framework, and wrote a
      couple of PEPs.</li>

      <li>SQL is how I talk to my favorite database, Postgres, which I
      love to use for many of my projects.  I've deployed RedShift
      based solutions and are just now starting to experiment with
      Citus.</li>

      <li>Bash is my pocket knife.</li>

      <li>Lisp is such a pretty thing, I can't help but admire it's
      elegance.</li>

      <li>And, you know, some Java.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most of my repositories here reflect learning exercises I've
    undertaken to acquire new skills and experiences with specific
    software tools.  It goes back quite some time so some of this code
    is really no longer relevant.</p>
